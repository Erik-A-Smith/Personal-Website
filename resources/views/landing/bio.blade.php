My name is Erik, <br><br>
I am a professional developper currently living in Montreal. Having worked several years in computer science both in school and on the job, I have innevitably come across many programming languages.
Some of my favorites include C++ and python for their efficiency and ease of access respectively.
I am familiar with a veriety of frameworks such as Laravel and .NET.<br><br>
In my spare time I enjoy building computers, making video games and developing various helpfull applications which you can browse on this website!<br>
All the codebase for these apps can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Erik-A-Smith">my github</a>.
