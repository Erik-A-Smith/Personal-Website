  	<h3 class="">Me</h3>
	<p>
		Apart from being a web developer, in my spare time I am an avid runner, game developer, novice skiier and a black belt in Karate.<br>
		When I have down time, I can usually be found listening to Podcasts while researching the newest technologies.<br>
		Keeping up to date with news and latest tech trends is a fundamental part of who I am.
